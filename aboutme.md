My academic interest lies in fMRI(functional magnetic resonance imaging), and I am currently advised by [Qiyuan Tian](https://www.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1357/4249.htm) and [Jingyuan Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/jingyuan-e-chen/about).

You can contact me via this email: 1747233637zx at gmail dot com

I'll write the rest when I come up with something.
