My academic interest lies in fMRI(functional magnetic resonance imaging) and fPET(functional positron emission tomography), and I am currently advised by [Qiyuan Tian](https://www.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1357/4249.htm) and [Jingyuan Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/jingyuan-e-chen/about).

Actually, I am a newbie in this field, since I don't know much about math :(

But I am trying to figure out everything :)

You can contact me via this email: 1747233637zx at gmail dot com
