I am a senior student at the School of Biomedical Engineering at Tsinghua University and will be pursuing a master's degree still at Tsinghua University.
Very good.
My academic interest lies in AI, and now I am doing some AI4Science work mainly in medical imaging. I am currently advised by [Hua Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wQhy7EEAAAAJ&hl=en).(We all call him guoguo)
Previously, I did some analysis about fMRI(functional magnetic resonance imaging) and fPET(functional positron emission tomography), and I was advised by [Qiyuan Tian](https://www.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1357/4249.htm) and [Jingyuan Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/jingyuan-e-chen/about).

Actually, I am a newbie in this field :(

But I am trying to figure out everything :)
