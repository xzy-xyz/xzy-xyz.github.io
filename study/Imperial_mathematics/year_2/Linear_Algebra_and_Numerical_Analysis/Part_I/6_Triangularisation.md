### Good properties of triangular matrices

1. Upper triangular matrices are closed under multiplication by a scalar, under sum and under product.

  If

  $$
  A = \begin{pmatrix}
  \lambda_1 & * & * \\
  0 & \lambda_2 & * \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  0 & 0 & \lambda_n
  \end{pmatrix}

  \text{ and }

  B = \begin{pmatrix}
  \mu_1 & * & * \\
  0 & \mu_2 & * \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  0 & 0 & \mu_n
  \end{pmatrix}
  $$

  then

  $$
  \beta A = \begin{pmatrix}
  \beta \lambda_1 & * & * \\
  0 & \beta \lambda_2 & * \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  0 & 0 & \beta \lambda_n
  \end{pmatrix}
  $$

  $$
  A + B = \begin{pmatrix}
  \lambda_1 + \mu_1 & * & * \\
  0 & \lambda_2 + \mu_2 & * \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  0 & 0 & \lambda_n + \mu_n
  \end{pmatrix}
  $$

  $$
  A B = \begin{pmatrix}
  \lambda_1 \mu_1 & * & * \\
  0 & \lambda_2 \mu_2 & * \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  0 & 0 & \lambda_n \mu_n
  \end{pmatrix}
  $$

2. The determinant, characteristic polynomial and eigenvalues of an upper triangular matrix are easy to compute.

  $$
  \begin{cases}
  \det A  = \prod_{i=1}^n \lambda_i\\
  c_A(x)  = \prod_{i=1}^n (x - \lambda_i)\text{ (A product of linear factor) }\\
  \text{Eigenvalues}  = \set{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \cdots, \lambda_n}
  \end{cases}
  $$

### Characteristic polynomials and triangularisation

#### Theorem (Triangularisation Theorem)

- $$V$$ is an n-dimensional vector space over a field $$\F$$.
  
- $$T: V \rightarrow V$$ is a linear map
  
- The characteristic polynomial $$c(x)$$ of $$T$$ could be factorized as a product of linear factors, i.e. 
  
  $$
  c(x)=\prod_{1}^{n}\left(x-\lambda_{i}\right)\text{ with all }\lambda_{i} \in \F
  $$
  
Then, **there is a basis $$B$$ of $$V$$ such that the matrix $$[T]_{B}$$ is upper triangular.**

**Proof**: (By induction on $$n = \di V$$)

- `Base case`: $$n = 1$$, the result is obvious since every $$1 \times 1$$ matrix is upper triangular.

- `Inductive step`: Assume the result is true for $$n - 1$$. Let $$n = \di V$$ and $$T: V \to V$$ be a linear map whose characteristic polynomial

  $$
  c(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n (x - \lambda_i)
  $$

  could be factorized as a product of linear factors. Then $$c(x)$$ has a root $$\lambda \in \F$$. For each root, there is at least one corresponding eigenvector $$w_1 \in V$$ such that $$T(w_1) = \lambda w_1$$. Let $$W = \operatorname{Span}(w_1)$$, then $$W$$ is a $$T$$-invariant subspace of $$V$$.

  Now, we are in the situation that we disscussed before:

  - $$T: V \to V$$ is a linear map
  
  - $$T(W) \subset W$$

  Now, we consider the quotient space $$V / W$$ and the quotient $$\bar{T}: V / W \to V / W$$. 

  - From the previous proposition, the dimension of $$V / W$$ is

    $$
    \di (V / W) = \di V - \di W = n - 1
    $$

  - From the previous corollary, the characteristic polynomial of $$\bar{T}$$ is

    $$
    \bar{c}(x) = \frac{c(x)}{x - \lambda}
    $$

    that could divide the characteristic polynomial of $$T$$, which is $$c(x)$$. Therefore, $$\bar{c}(x)$$ could be factorized as a product of linear factors.

  - By inductive hypothesis, there is a basis $$\bar{B} = \set{W + v_2, W + v_3, \cdots, W + v_n}$$ of $$V / W$$ such that the matrix $$[\bar{T}]_{\bar{B}}$$ is upper triangular.

Finally, by the proposition that we introduced in last section, we have

$$
[T]_B = \begin{pmatrix}
\lambda & * \\
0 & [\bar{T}]_{\bar{B}}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where $$B = \set{w_1, v_2, v_3, \cdots, v_n}$$ is a basis of $$V$$ and $$*$$ is some $$1 \times (n - 1)$$ matrix. It follows that $$[T]_B$$ is upper triangular.


#### Corollary (A matirx with factorizable characteristic polynomial is triangularisable)

- $$A$$ is an $$n \times n$$ matrix over a field $$\F$$
  
- The characteristic polynomial of $$A$$ could be factorized as a product of linear factors. i.e 
  
  $$
  c(x)=\prod_{1}^{n}\left(x-\lambda_{i}\right)\text{ with all }\lambda_{i} \in \F
  $$
  
Then, **$$A$$ is similar to an upper triangular matrix over $$F$$.**

**Proof**:

- $$V = \F^n$$ is an $$n$$-dimensional vector space over $$\F$$.

- Apply Triangularisation Theorem to the linear map $$T: V \to V$$ defined by $$T(v) = Av$$.

- Then, there is a basis $$B = \set{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n}$$ of $$V$$ such that the matrix $$[T]_B$$ is upper triangular.

- Since $$[T]_B = [A]_B$$, $$A$$ is similar to an upper triangular matrix over $$F$$.

> Remark:
>
> - If $$\F = \C$$, by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, the characteristic polynomial of $$A$$ could always be factorized as a product of linear factors. Therefore, **every matrix is triangularisable in $$\C$$.**
>
> - If $$\F = \R$$, some matrices could not be triangularisable. For example, the rotation matrices of $$\R^{2n} n \in \N$$ could not be triangularisable in $$\R$$.
>
> $$\begin{pmatrix}
 0 & 1\\
  -1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$
> which has characteristic polynomial $$x^2 + 1$$ that could not be factorized as a product of linear factors in $$\R$$.

#### The algorithm for triangularising a linear map (assuming the characteristic polynomial could be factorized as a product of linear factors)

1. Find an eigenvector $$w_1$$ for $$T$$ and let $$W_1 = \operatorname{Span}(w_1)$$

2. Consider the quotienet map $$\bar{T}: V / W_1 \to V / W_1$$.

3. Find an eigenvector $$W + w_2$$ for $$\bar{T}: V / W_1 \to V / W_1$$ and let $$W_2 = \operatorname{Span}(w_1, w_2)$$

4. Repeat the process until we get a basis $$B = \set{w_1, w_2, \cdots, w_n}$$ of $$V$$. Then the matrix $$[T]_B$$ is upper triangular.
