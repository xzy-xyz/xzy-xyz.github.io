> For the following we assume that $$G$$ and $$H$$ are groups, $$f$$ is a function, $$f: G \rightarrow H$$ and $$e$$ is the unit element in a group.

## 1. Homomorphisms and normal subgroups

### 1.1 Homomorphisms, isomorphisms and automorphisms

#### Definition 1.1 (Homomorphism)

A function $$f: G \rightarrow H$$ is called a **homomorphism** if for any $$a, b \in G$$ we have $$f(a b)=f(a) f(b)$$.

#### Proposition 1.2 (Homorphism preserves identity and inverses)

If we $$e_G$$ to denote the unit element of $$G$$ and $$e_H$$ to denote the unit element of $$H$$ and assume $$f: G \rightarrow H$$ is a homomorphism, then $$f(e_G)=e_H$$.

For any $$g \in G$$ the image of the inverse $$g^{-1}$$ is $$f(g^{-1})=f(g)^{-1}$$.

**Proof**:

$$f$$ is a homomorphism, we have:

$$
f(e_G)=f(e_G e_G)=f(e_G) f(e_G)
$$

If we multiply both sides by $$f(e_G)^{-1}$$ on the right, then we get

$$
f(e_G)=e_H
$$

By the axioms of groups, for any $$g \in G$$, we have:

$$
g^{-1} \in G \text{ and } g g^{-1}=e_G
$$

Since $$f$$ is a homomorphism, we have:

$$
f(e_G) = f(g g^{-1}) = f(g) f(g^{-1}) = e_H
$$

Since $$f(g) \in H$$, the inverse of $$f(g)$$ is $$f(g)^{-1}$$ is unique. Therefore, we have:

$$
f(g^{-1}) = f(g)^{-1}
$$

#### Examples

1. Let $$Mat(n,\R)$$ be the group of $$n\times n$$ matrices with real entries with the operation of matrix addtion. The trace $$tr: Mat(n,\R) \rightarrow \R$$ is a homomorphism.

    **Proof**:

    Let $$A, B \in Mat(n,\R)$$, then we have:

    $$
    tr(A + B) = \sum_{i=1}^n (a_{ii} + b_{ii}) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii} + \sum_{i=1}^n b_{ii} = tr(A) + tr(B)
    $$

2. (1) Let $$\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{R})$$ be the group of invertible $$n \times n$$-matrices with real entries with respect to multiplication of matrices. The determinant det: $$\operatorname{GL}(n, \mathbb{R}) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\times}$$is a homomorphism to the multiplicative group $$\mathbb{R}^{\times}=\mathbb{R} \backslash\{0\}$$.

    **Proof**:

    Let $$A, B \in GL(n, \R)$$, then we have:

    $$
    det(AB) = det(A) det(B)
    $$

3. Let $$S_n$$ be the symmetric group of permutations of $$\{1,2,...,n\}$$. Then the sigh of a permuation $$sgn: S_n \rightarrow \{\pm 1\}$$ is a homomorphism to a cyclic group of order 2.

    **Proof**:

    We could regard $$\{\pm 1\}$$ as a cyclic group of order 2 with respect to multiplication, i.e. $$\{e^0 ,e^{\pi}\}$$, where $$e^0 = 1$$ and $$e^{\pi} = -1$$.

    Let $$\sigma, \tau \in S_n$$, then we have:

    $$
    sgn(\sigma \tau) = \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } \sigma \tau \text{ are both even or both odd} \\
        -1 & \text{if one of } \sigma \tau \text{ is even and the other is odd} 
    \end{cases}
    $$

    For $$sgn(\sigma) sgn(\tau)$$, we have:

    $$
    sgn(\sigma) sgn(\tau) = \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } \sigma \text{ and } \tau \text{ are both even or both odd} \\
        -1 & \text{if one of } \sigma \text{ is even and the other is odd}
    \end{cases}
    $$
    
#### Proposition 1.3 (Composition of homomorphisms)

If $$f: G \to H$$ and $$g: H \to K$$ are homomorphisms, then the compostion $$g \circ f: G \to K$$ is also a homomorphism.

**Proof**:

Let $$a, b \in G$$, since $$f$$ is a homomorphism, we have:

$$
f(a b) = f(a) f(b)
$$

Since $$g$$ is a homomorphism, we have:

$$
g(f(a b)) = g(f(a) f(b)) = g(f(a)) g(f(b))
$$

Therefore, we have:

$$
g \circ f(a b) = (g \circ f)(a) (g \circ f)(b)
$$

#### Definition 1.4 (Isomorphism)

A function $$f: G \rightarrow H$$ is called an **isomorphism** if it is a homomorphism and a bijection.

and if $$f$$ is a isomorphism, we write

$$
f: G \overset{\sim}{\rightarrow} H
$$

if $$G$$ and $$H$$ are isomorphic groups, we write

$$
G \overset{\sim}{=} H
$$

##### Remark

The identify map $$id_G: G \rightarrow G$$ is clearly an isomorphism.

#### Proposition 1.5 (Inverse of an isomorphism)

If $$f: G \overset{\sim}{\rightarrow} H$$ is an isomorphism, since it is a bijection, then there exists a inverse map $$f^{-1}: H \rightarrow G$$, defined by $$f^{-1}(y) = x$$ if and only if $$f(x) = y$$, which is also an isomorphism and $$f^{-1} \circ f = id_G$$ and $$f \circ f^{-1} = id_H$$.

**Proof**:

1. Assume $$h_1, h_2 \in H$$ be arbitrary. Since $$f$$ is a bijection, there exists $$g_1, g_2 \in G$$ such that $$f(g_1) = h_1$$ and $$f(g_2) = h_2$$. Since $$f$$ is a homomorphism, we have:

    $$
    h_1h_2 = f(g_1)f(g_2)
    $$

    Then, we have

    $$
    f^{-1}(h_1h_2) = f^{-1}(f(g_1)f(g_2)) = f^{-1}(f(g_1g_2)) = g_1g_2 = f^{-1}(h_1)f^{-1}(h_2)
    $$

    Therefore, $$f^{-1}$$ is a homomorphism. Since $$f$$ is a bijection, then its inverse $$f^{-1}$$ is also a bijection. Therefore, $$f^{-1}$$ is an isomorphism.

2. Since $$f$$ is a bijection, then for any $$g \in G$$, there exists $$h \in H$$ such that $$f(g) = h$$. Therefore, we have:

    $$
    f^{-1}(f(g)) = f^{-1}(h) = g
    $$

    Therefore, we have $$f^{-1} \circ f = id_G$$.

    It is the same for $$f \circ f^{-1} = id_H$$.

#### Remark

1. Isomorphism is an equivalence relation on the set of all groups.

   **Proof**:

   1. (Reflexive) Let $$G$$ be a group, then the identity map $$id_G: G \rightarrow G$$ is an isomorphism, therefore, $$G \overset{\sim}{=} G$$.

   2. (Symmetric) Let $$G \overset{\sim}{=} H$$, then there exists an isomorphism $$f: G \rightarrow H$$. Since $$f$$ is a bijection, then its inverse $$f^{-1}: H \rightarrow G$$ is also a bijection. Since $$f$$ is a homomorphism, then $$f^{-1}$$ is also a homomorphism. Therefore, $$f^{-1}$$ is an isomorphism and $$H \overset{\sim}{=} G$$.

   3. (Transitive) Let $$G \overset{\sim}{=} H$$ and $$H \overset{\sim}{=} K$$, then there exists isomorphisms $$f: G \rightarrow H$$ and $$g: H \rightarrow K$$. Since $$f$$ and $$g$$ are bijections, then the composition $$g \circ f: G \rightarrow K$$ is also a bijection. Since $$f$$ and $$g$$ are homomorphisms, then the composition $$g \circ f$$ is also a homomorphism. Therefore, $$g \circ f$$ is an isomorphism and $$G \overset{\sim}{=} K$$.

2. Isomorphic groups means we could not distinguish them by their algebraic properties.

    Example:

    A cyclic group of order $$nm$$ 

    $$
    C_n = \{a^0, a^1, a^2, ..., a^{n-1}\}
    $$

    and the group of residues modulo $$n$$ denoted by 

    $$
    \Z \backslash n = \{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1\}
    $$

    with the group law written additively, that is, $$a + b$$ is the remainder of $$a + b$$ modulo $$n$$. Therefore, the function

    $$
    f: \Z\backslash n \rightarrow C_n
    $$

    where $$f(i) = a^i$$ is an isomorphism.

#### Definition 1.6 (Automorphism)

Let $$G$$ be a group. An isomorphism $$f: G \stackrel{\sim}{\longrightarrow} G$$ is called an **automorphism** of $$G$$.

#### Examples

1. Let $$G$$ be a group. The identity map $$id_G: G \rightarrow G$$ is an automorphism.

2. The self-map $$G \to G$$ that sends $$g$$ to $$g^{-1}$$ is an automorphism if and only if $$G$$ is Abelian.

    **Proof**:

    $$\Rightarrow$$: Assume $$f: G \to G$$ with $$f(g) = g^{-1}$$ is an an automorphism and let $$a ,b \in G$$ be arbitrary then

    $$
    f(a b) = (a b)^{-1} = b^{-1} a^{-1} = f(b) f(a)
    $$

    Since $$f$$ is an automorphism, then $$f$$ is a homomorphism. 

    $$
    f(a b) = f(a) f(b)
    $$

    Therefore, we have $$f(a) f(b) = f(b) f(a)$$ since $$f$$ is an bijection,its image is the whole group $$G$$. Therefore, $$G$$ is abelian.

    $$\Leftarrow$$: Assume $$G$$ is Abelian and $$f: G \to G$$ with $$f(g) = g^{-1}$$. We need to show that $$f$$ is a homomorphism and a bijection.

    1. (Homomorphism) Let $$a, b \in G$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

        $$
        f(a b) = (a b)^{-1} = b^{-1} a^{-1} = f(b) f(a) = f(a) f(b)
        $$

        since $$G$$ is Abelian.

    2. (Bijection) 
        1. (Injective) The uniquness of the inverse of an element in a group implies that $$f$$ is injective.
        
        2. (Surjective) By the axioms of groups, for any element in $$G$$, there exists an inverse. Therefore, $$f$$ is surjective.


#### Proposition 1.7 (The group of automorphisms on a group)

Let $$G$$ be a group, then the set of all automorphisms of $$G$$ forms a group with the unit element $$id_G$$ and the operation of composition. The groups is denoted by 

$$
Aut(G)
$$

Thus, for any group $$G$$, we associated another group $$Aut(G)$$.

**Proof**:

1. (Closure) Let $$f, g \in Aut(G)$$, then $$f \circ g$$ is also an automorphism.(From the following proposition)

2. (Associativity) Since composition of functions is associative, then the composition of automorphisms is also associative.

3. (Unit element) The identity map $$id_G$$ is an automorphism.

4. (Inverse) Let $$f \in Aut(G)$$, then $$f^{-1}$$ is also an automorphism. (From the following proposition)

Therefore, the set of all automorphisms of $$G$$ forms a group with the unit element $$id_G$$ and the operation of composition.

#### Examples

1. $$Aut(\Z) = \{f(x) | f(x) = x + n, x\in \Z, n \in \Z\}$$

2. $$Aut(\Z \backslash n) = \{f(s)| f(s) = \{ nk + a | a \in (0, n), k \in \Z \} , s \in \Z \backslash n\}$$

#### Definition 1.8 (Conjugation)

Let $$G$$ be a group and take $$g \in G$$. The function $$G \to G$$ defined by $$x \mapsto g x g^{-1}$$ is called **conjugation** by $$g$$.

#### Proposition 1.9 (Conjugation is an automorphism)

Let $$G$$ be a group and take $$g \in G$$. The function $$G \to G$$ defined by $$x \mapsto g x g^{-1}$$ is an automorphism.

**Proof**:

1. (Homomorphism) Let $$x, y \in G$$ be arbitrary and $$f$$ denote the conjugation by $$g$$, then we have:

    $$
    f(xy) = g(xy)g^{-1} = gx(g^{-1} g) y g^{-1} = (gxg^{-1})(gyg^{-1}) = f(x)f(y)
    $$

2. (Bijection) 
   1. (Injective) Let $$x, y \in G$$ be arbitrary and $$f$$ denote the conjugation by $$g$$, then we have:

        $$
        f(x) = f(y) \Rightarrow gxg^{-1} = gyg^{-1} \Rightarrow x = y
        $$

        Therefore, $$f$$ is injective.
    
    2. (Surjective) Let $$x \in G$$ be arbitrary and $$f$$ denote the conjugation by $$g$$, then we have:

        $$
        f(g^{-1} x g) = g(g^{-1} x g) g^{-1} = x
        $$

        Therefore, $$f$$ is surjective.

### 1.2. Normal subgroups, quotient groups and the isomorphism theorem

#### Definition 1.10 (Stable under conjugation)

Let $$G$$ be a group and $$H$$ be a subgroup of $$G$$. We say that $$H$$ is **stable under conjugation** if for any $$g \in G$$ we have $$g h g^{-1} \in H$$ for any $$h \in H$$.

#### Definition 1.11 (Normal subgroup)

Let $$G$$ be a group. A subgroup $$S \subset G$$ is called **normal** if it is stable under the conjugation by any element of $$G$$.


#### Definition 1.12 (Image and kernel of a homomorphism)

To a homomorphism $$f: G \rightarrow H$$ we associate its image

$$
\operatorname{Im}(f)=f(G)=\{f(x) \mid x \in G\} \subset H
$$

and its kernel

$$
\operatorname{Ker}(f)=\left\{x \in G \mid f(x)=e_{H}\right\}
$$

#### Lemma 1.13 (A homomorphism is injective if and only if its kernel is trivial)

Let $$f: G \rightarrow H$$ be a homomorphism. Then $$f$$ is an injective if and only if $$\operatorname{Ker}(f)=\{e_{G}\}$$.

**Proof**:

$$\Rightarrow$$: Since $$f$$ is homomorphism, then $$f(e_G) = e_H$$, so $$e_G \in \ke(f)$$. Since $$f$$ is injective, then $$|\ke(f)| \leq 1$$. Therefore, $$\ke(f) = \{e_G\}$$.

$$\Leftarrow$$: Assume $$\ke(f) = \{e_G\}$$ and $$f(g_1) = f(g_2)$$, then we have:

$$
f(g_1) = f(g_2) \Rightarrow f(g_1) f(g_2)^{-1} = e_H \Rightarrow f(g_1 g_2^{-1}) = e_H \Rightarrow g_1 g_2^{-1} \in \ke(f) \Rightarrow g_1 g_2^{-1} = e_G \Rightarrow g_1 = g_2
$$


#### Proposition 1.14 (Kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup)

Let $$f: G \rightarrow H$$ be a homomorphism of a group. Then $$\operatorname{Im}(f)$$ is a subgroup of $$H$$ and $$\operatorname{Ker}(f)$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$. Moreover, $$\operatorname{Ker}(f)$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$.

**Proof**:

1. (Image is subgroup) To prove this, we check the defintion of subgroups.  

    1. (Identity) Since $$f$$ is a homomorphism, then $$f(e_G) = e_H$$. Therefore, $$e_H \in \operatorname{Im}(f)$$.

    2. (Closure) Let $$h_1, h_2 \in \operatorname{Im}(f)$$ be arbitrary, then there exists $$g_1, g_2 \in G$$ such that $$f(g_1) = h_1$$ and $$f(g_2) = h_2$$. Since $$f$$ is a homomorphism, then we have:

        $$
        f(g_1 g_2) = f(g_1) f(g_2) = h_1 h_2
        $$

        Therefore, $$h_1 h_2 \in \operatorname{Im}(f)$$.

    3. (Inverse) Let $$h \in \operatorname{Im}(f)$$ be arbitrary, then there exists $$g \in G$$ such that $$f(g) = h$$. Since $$f$$ is a homomorphism, then we have:

        $$
        f(g^{-1}) = f(g)^{-1} = h^{-1}
        $$

        Therefore, $$h^{-1} \in \operatorname{Im}(f)$$.

2. (Kernel is subgroup)

    1. (Identity) Since $$f$$ is a homomorphism, then $$f(e_G) = e_H$$. Therefore, $$e_G \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)$$.

    2. (Closure) Let $$g_1, g_2 \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

        $$
        f(g_1 g_2) = f(g_1) f(g_2) = e_H e_H = e_H
        $$

        Therefore, $$g_1 g_2 \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)$$.

    3. (Inverse) Let $$g \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

        $$
        f(g^{-1}) = f(g)^{-1} = e_H^{-1} = e_H
        $$

        Therefore, $$g^{-1} \in \operatorname{Ker}(f)$$.

3. (Kernal is normal)

    Assume $$x \in \ke(f)$$ be arbitrary and $$g \in G$$ be any element, then we have:

    $$
    f(g x g^{-1}) = f(g) f(x) f(g^{-1}) = f(g) e_H f(g^{-1}) = f(g) f(g^{-1}) = f(g g^{-1}) = f(e_G) = e_H
    $$

    then $$g x g^{-1} \in \ke(f)$$. Therefore, $$\ke(f)$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$.

#### Definition 1.15 (Simple group)

A group $$G$$ is called **simple** if it has no normal subgroups other than $$\{e\}$$ and $$G$$.

#### Examples

1. If $$p$$ is a prime number, then the cyclic group $$C_p$$ is a simple group.

    **Proof**:

    Assume $$H$$ is a normal subgroup of $$C_p$$, then $$H$$ is a subgroup of $$C_p$$ and $$H \neq \{e\}$$ and $$H \neq C_p$$. Since $$C_p$$ is a cyclic group, then $$H = \langle a^k \rangle$$ for some $$k \in \{1, 2, ..., p-1\}$$. Since $$H$$ is a normal subgroup of $$C_p$$, then for any $$g \in C_p$$, we have $$g H g^{-1} = H$$. Therefore, we have:

    $$
    g H g^{-1} = \{g h g^{-1} | h \in H\} = \{g a^k g^{-1} | k \in \{1, 2, ..., p-1\}\} = \{a^k | k \in \{1, 2, ..., p-1\}\} = H
    $$

    which is a contradiction. Therefore, $$C_p$$ is a simple group.

    Actually, there is a strong result that every cyclic group with prime order has no subgroup other than $$\{e\}$$ and itself.

    **Proof**:

    Assume $$H$$ is a subgroup of $$C_p$$ and $$H \neq \{e\}$$ and $$H \neq C_p$$. Since $$C_p$$ is a cyclic group, then $$H = \langle a^k \rangle$$ for some $$k \in \{1, 2, ..., p\}$$. Since $$H \neq \{e\}$$, then $$k \neq 1$$. Since $$H \neq C_p$$, then $$k \neq p$$. Therefore, $$k$$ is a proper divisor of $$p$$. Since $$p$$ is a prime number, then $$p$$ has no proper divisors. Therefore, $$H$$ does not exist.


2. If $$G$$ is Abelian, then any subgroup of $$G$$ is simple.

   **Proof**:

   Assume $$H$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$ and let $$h \in H$$ and $$g \in G$$ be arbitrary. Since $$G$$ is Abelian, then we have:

   $$
   g h g^{-1} = g g^{-1} h = h \in H
    $$

    Therefore, $$H$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$. Since $$G$$ is Abelian, then $$H$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$ and $$H \neq \{e\}$$ and $$H \neq G$$. Therefore, $$H$$ is a simple group.

3. Consider the symmetric groups $$S_3$$, and let $$G =\{e, (1 2) \}\subset S_3$$. It is clearly that $$G$$ is a subgroup of $$S_3$$. But $$G$$ is not a normal subgroup of $$G$$.

$$
(13) (12) (13) = (13) (12) (13) = (23) \notin G
$$

#### Lemma 1.16 (Left coset and right coset equal means normal subgroup)

If $$H \subset G$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$, and $$g H = H g$$ for every $$g \in G$$, then $$H$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$.

**Proof**:

Let $$h \in H$$ and $$g \in G$$ be arbitrary, since the left coset and right coset are equal, then we have:

$$
g h = h g
$$

We multiply both sides by $$g^{-1}$$ on the right, then we have:

$$
g h g^{-1} = h
$$

Therefore, $$H$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$.

#### Definition 1.17 (The product of left cosets of a normal subgroup)

Assume $$N$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$ and let $$g_1, g_2 \in G$$, then we define a group structure on the set $$G / N$$ of left cosets of $$N$$ in $$G$$ by setting

$$
(g_1N)(g_2N) = \{ab| a \in g_1N, b\in g_2 N\}
$$

which is the set of all the products of an element from $$g_1N$$ and an element from $$g_2N$$.

#### Lemma 1.18

Let $$N$$ be a normal subgroup of $$G$$. For any $$g_{1}, g_{2} \in G$$ we have

$$
(g_1N)(g_2 N) = g_1g_2N
$$

**Proof**:

Let $$x, y \in N$$ be arbitrary, then $$(g_1 x)(g_2 y) = g_1(g_2 g_2^{-1}xg_2)y$$. Since $$N$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$, then $$g_2^{-1}xg_2 \in N$$. Therefore, we could find a $$z \in N$$ such that $$g_2^{-1}xg_2 = z$$. Therefore, we have:

$$
(g_1x) (g_2y) = g_1(g_2 g_2^{-1}xg_2)y = g_1 g_2 z y
$$

If we set $$y = e_G$$, then the proof is done.

#### Definition 1.19 (Quotient group)

Let $$N$$ be a normal subgroup of $$G$$, then the set of all the left cosets of $$N$$ in $$G$$ is denoted by $$G / N = \{gN | g \in G\}$$ and is called the **quotient group** of $$G$$ by $$N$$. The group law on $$G / N$$ is given by $$(g_1 N)(g_2 N) = g_1 g_2 N$$.

We show that the quotient group is well-defined.

1. (Closure) Let $$g_1, g_2 \in G$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

    $$
    (g_1 N)(g_2 N) = g_1 g_2 N
    $$

    Since $$N$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$, then $$g_1 g_2 \in G$$. Therefore, $$g_1 g_2 N \in G / N$$.

2. (Associativity) Since $$G$$ is a group, then the product of two elements in $$G$$ is associative. Therefore, the product of two elements in $$G / N$$ is associative.

3. (Unit element) Since $$N$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$, then $$e_G \in N$$. Therefore, $$e_G N = N$$ is the unit element of $$G / N$$.

4. (Inverse) Let $$gN \in G/N$$ be arbitrary, since $$N$$ is a normal subgroup. The inverse of $$gN$$ is $$g^{-1}N$$ .i.e.

$$
(gN)(g^{-1}N) = g g^{-1} N = e_G N
$$


#### Proposition 1.20

Let $$N$$ be a normal subgroup of $$G$$. The function $$f: G \rightarrow G / N$$ given by $$g \mapsto g N$$ is a surjective homomorphism with kernel $$\operatorname{Ker}(f)=N$$.

**Proof**:

1. (Homomorphism) Let $$g_1, g_2 \in G$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

    $$
    f(g_1 g_2) = g_1 g_2 N = (g_1 N)(g_2 N) = f(g_1) f(g_2)
    $$

    Therefore, $$f$$ is a homomorphism.

2. The surjectivity of $$f$$ is obvious.

3. (Kernel) Let $$g \in \ke(f)$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

    $$
    f(g) = g N = N \Rightarrow g \in N
    $$

    Therefore, $$\ke(f) = N$$.

#### Theorem 1.21 (First isomorphism theorem)

Let $$f: G \rightarrow H$$ be a homomorphism. The map $$\phi:g \operatorname{Ker}(f) \mapsto f(g)$$ is an isomorphism of groups

$$
G / \operatorname{Ker}(f) \stackrel{\sim}{\longrightarrow} f(G) .
$$

and 

$$
G/ \ke(f) \iso \im(f)
$$

**Proof**:

Since $$\ke(f)$$ is a normal subgroup, then $$g\ke(f)$$ is a group.


Next, we check $$\phi$$ is isomorphism.

1. (Homomorphism) Let $$g_1 \ke(f)$$ and $$g_2\ke(f) \in G/\ke(f)$$ be arbitrary. Then we

    $$
    \phi(g_1\ke(f)g_2\ke(f)) = \phi(g_1g_2\ke(f)) = f(g_1g_2) = f(g_1)f(g_2) = \phi(g_1\ke(f))\phi(g_2\ke(f))
    $$

2. (Bijectivity)

    1. (Surjective) The surjectivity of $$\phi$$ is obvious.

    2. (Injective) It we could show that the $$\ke(\phi) = \{e_{G/\ke(f)}\}$$, then $$\phi$$ is injective.

        Let $$g \in \ke(\phi)$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

        $$
        \phi(g) = f(g) = e_H
        $$

        Therefore, $$g \in \ke(f)$$, then $$g\ke(f) = \ke(f)$$. Therefore, $$\ke(\phi) = \{e_G \ke(f)\}$$.


#### Remark

Assume $$f: G \rightarrow H$$ is a homomorphism, then we have:

- (Homorphism preserves subgroups of images and preimages)
  
  - If $$A \subset G$$ is a subgroup, then $$f(A) \subset H$$ is a subgroup.

    - Since the homomorphism preserves the group law. Therefore, $$f(A)$$ is closed under the group law.

  - If $$B \subset H$$ is a subgroup, then $$f^{-1}(B) \subset G$$ is a subgroup.
  
    -  (Unit element)$$e_G \in f^{-1}(B)$$ since $$f(e_G) = e_H \in B$$.
    -  (Closed under inverse) If $$g \in f^{-1}(B)$$, then $$f(g) \in B$$. Since $$B$$ is a subgroup, then $$f(g)^{-1} \in B$$. We know that $$f^{-1}(g) = f(g^{-1})$$, then $$g^{-1} \in f^{-1}(B)$$.

- (Homomorphism preserves normal subgroups of preimages) If $$N \subset H$$ is a normal subgroup, then $$f^{-1}(N) \subset G$$ is a normal subgroup.

    - (Normal) Let $$x \in f^{-1}(B)$$ and $$g \in G$$ be arbitrary. Then,

        $$
        f(x) \in N
        $$

        Since $$N$$ is normal,

        $$
        f(g)f(x)f(g)^{-1} \in N \Longrightarrow f(gxg^{-1}) \in N \Longrightarrow gxg^{-1} \in f^{-1}(N) 
        $$

        Therefore, $$f^{-1}(N)$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$.

- The image of a normal subgroup of a homomorphism does not have to be normal subgroup. E.g.

    - $$G = S_3 \text{ and } A = S_2 \subset S_3$$. $$A$$ is not a normal subgroup of $$S_3$$ but $$A$$ is the normal subgroup of itself. Consider the identity homomorphism $$id: A \to G$$. Then $$id(A) = A$$ is not a normal subgroup of $$G$$.

    If $$f: G \to H$$ is a surjective homomorphism, then if $$A$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$, then $$f(A)$$ is a normal subgroup of $$H$$.

    **Proof**: 

    Since $$f$$ is surjective, then $$f(A) = H$$. We could have this:\

    $$
    f(g)f(A)f(g)^{-1} = f(gAg^{-1}) \in f(A)
    $$

    Therefore, $$f(A)$$ is a normal subgroup of $$H$$.

#### Proposition 1.22 (Correspondece theorem)

Let $$N$$ be a normal subgroup of $$G$$. Let $$f:G \to G/N$$ be the surjective homomorphism $$g \mapsto gN$$. Then f is a bijection:

$$
G_1 = \left\{\text{subgroups } S \subset G \text { that contain } N\right\} \stackrel{\stackrel{f}{\sim}}{\longrightarrow}\left\{\text{subgroups of } G / N\right\} = G_2
$$

Moreover, $$S$$ is normal in $$G$$ if and only if $$S/N$$ is normal in $$G/N$$.

**Proof**:

1. Since $$N$$ is a normal subgroup in $$G$$, in particular, $$N$$ is a subgroup of $$S$$. As $$N = \ke(f)$$, then $$S/N = f(S)$$ is a subgroup of $$G/N$$ by the first isomorphism theorem.  

2. To show there is a bijection, we need to show that there is a map which composition is the identity map from both sides of domain and codomain meaning that we need to find $$f^{-1}$$. We notice that $$S$$ is the disjoint union of the cosets $$gN, g\in S$$.

    $$
    S = \bigcup_{g \in S} gN \text{ (disjoin union)}
    $$

    - $$f^{-1} \circ f = id_{G_1}$$: Let $$S \in G_1$$ be a subgroup that contains $$N$$, then we have:

        $$
        f^{-1}(f(S)) = f^{-1}\left(f\left(\bigcup_{g \in S} gN\right)\right) = \bigcup_{g \in S} f\circ f^{-1}(gN) = \bigcup_{g \in S} gN = S
        $$

    - $$f \circ f^{-1} = id_{G_2}$$: Let $$H \in G_2$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

        $$
        f (f^{-1}(H)) = H
        $$

3. By previous remark, since $$f$$ is a surjective homomorphism, then $$S$$ is normal if and only if $$f(S)$$ is normal. Therefore, $$S$$ is normal in $$G$$ if and only if $$S/N$$ is normal in $$G/N$$.

### 1.3. Group-theoretic constructions

#### Definition 1.23 (Group of Inner automorphism)

The set of the conjugations by the elements of $$G$$ forms a subgroup of $$Aut(G)$$, called the **group of inner automorphisms** of $$G$$ and denoted by $$Inn(G)$$, it is also called conjugation group of $$G$$.

**Proof**: 

We show that the inner automorphisms form a subgroup of $$Aut(G)$$.

- (Closure) Let $$f_1, f_2 \in Inn(G)$$ and $$x \in G$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

    $$
    f_1 \circ f_2 (x) = f_1(f_2(x)) = f_1([x \to g_2 x g_2^{-1}]) = [x \mapsto g_1 g_2 x g_2^{-1} g_1^{-1}] =[x\mapsto (g_1 g_2) x (g_1 g_2)^{-1}]
    $$
    Therefore, $$f_1 \circ f_2 \in Inn(G)$$.

- (Identity) The identity map $$id_G$$ is an inner automorphism.

- (Inverse) Let $$f \in Inn(G)$$ be arbitrary, if $$f(x) = [x \mapsto g x g^{-1}]$$, then $$f^{-1}(x) = [x \mapsto g^{-1} x g] =[x \mapsto g^{-1}x(g^{-1})^{-1}]$$. Therefore, $$f^{-1} \in Inn(G)$$.

#### Lemma 1.24

Let $$G$$ be a group and $$Aut(G)$$ be the associated automorphism group. The map $$\phi: G \to Inn(G)$$ sending the element $$g$$ of $$G$$ to the conjugation by $$g$$ is a homomorphism. Moreover, $$\ke(\phi) = \{g \in G| gx = xg, \forall x \in G\}$$.

**Proof**:

1. (Homomorphism) We have to show that for any $$a, b \in G$$ the conjugation by $$a b$$ is the composition of the conjugation by $$a$$ and the conjugation by $$b$$.
   
   Let $$x \in G$$ be arbitrary.

    $$
    \phi(a b) = [x \mapsto (a b) x (a b)^{-1}] = [x \mapsto a (b x b^{-1}) a^{-1}] = [x \mapsto a x a^{-1}] \circ [x \mapsto b x b^{-1}] = \phi(a) \circ \phi(b)
    $$

2. (Kernel) Let $$x \in \ke(\phi)$$ and $$g \in G$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

    $$
    \phi(x) = [x \mapsto x] \Longrightarrow  gxg^{-1} = x \Longrightarrow gx = xg
    $$

    Therefore, $$\ke(\phi) = \{g \in G| gx = xg, \forall x \in G\}$$.

#### Definition 1.25 (Center of a group)

Let $$G$$ be a group. The **center** of $$G$$ is the set of elements of $$G$$ that commute with all elements of $$G$$:

$$
Z(G) = \ke(\phi) = \{g\in G| gxg^{-1}, \forall x\in G\}=\{g \in G| gx = xg, \forall x \in G\}
$$

where $$\phi: G \to Inn(G)$$.

#### Remark

1. $$Z(G)$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$ since it is the kernel of the homomorphism $$\phi: G \to Inn(G)$$.

2. The first isomomorphism theorem tells us that $$G/Z(G) \iso Inn(G)$$.

3. $$Z(G) = G$$ if and only if $$G$$ is Abelian.

#### Definition 1.26 (Communtator)

Let $$G$$ be a group. For $$a, b \in G$$ we define the **commutator** of $$a$$ and $$b$$ as

$$
[a, b] = a b a^{-1} b^{-1}
$$

#### Remark

1. $$[a, b] = e_G$$ if and only if $$a b = b a$$.

2. $$[a, b] = [b, a]^{-1}$$. 

#### Lemma 1.27 (The intersection of subgroups is a subgroup)

Let $$I$$ be a set and $$G$$ be a group. Suppose that for each $$i \in I$$ we are given a subgroup $$G_{i} \subset G$$. Then the intersection $$\bigcap_{i \in I} G_{i}$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$.

**Proof**:

1. (Identity) Since $$e_G \in G_i$$ for all $$i \in I$$, then $$e_G \in \bigcap_{i \in I} G_{i}$$.

2. (Closure under group operation) Let $$x, y \in \bigcap_{i \in I} G_{i}$$ be arbitrary, then $$x, y \in G_i$$ for all $$i \in I$$. Since $$G_i$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$, then $$x y \in G_i$$ for all $$i \in I$$. Therefore, $$x y \in \bigcap_{i \in I} G_{i}$$.

3. (Closure under inverse) Let $$x \in \bigcap_{i \in I} G_{i}$$ be arbitrary, then $$x \in G_i$$ for all $$i \in I$$. Since $$G_i$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$, then $$x^{-1} \in G_i$$ for all $$i \in I$$. Therefore, $$x^{-1} \in \bigcap_{i \in I} G_{i}$$.

#### Definition 1.28 (Generated subgroup)

Let $$G$$ be a group and $$S$$ be a subgroup of $$G$$. The intersection of all subgroups of $$G$$ that contains $$S$$ (which is a subgroup of $$G$$ by the previous lemma) is called the **subgroup generated by $$S$$**. If the subgroup is $$G$$ itself, we say that $$S$$ **generates** $$G$$.

#### Definition 1.29 (Commutator subgroup)

Let $$G$$ be a group. The subgroup of $$G$$ generated by all commutators of $$G$$ is called the **commutator subgroup** of $$G$$ and is denoted by $$[G, G]$$.

#### Lemma 1.30 (A groups is Abelian if and only every commutator is the unit element)

$$[G, G] = \{e_G\}$$ if and only if $$G$$ is Abelian.

**Proof**:

1. ($$[G, G] = \{e_G\} \Rightarrow G \text{ is Abelian}$$) For every $$a, b \in G$$, we have

    $$
    [a, b] = e_G \Longrightarrow a b a^{-1} b^{-1} = e_G \Longrightarrow a b = b a
    $$

2. ($$G \text{ is Abelian} \Rightarrow [G, G] = \{e_G\}$$) For every $$a, b \in G$$, we have

    $$
    a b = b a \Longrightarrow a b a^{-1} b^{-1} = e_G \Longrightarrow [a, b] = e_G
    $$

#### Lemma 1.31 (The commutator subgroup is a normal subgroup and the quotient group of modulo the commutator subgroup is Abelian)

Let $$G$$ be a group. The commutator subgroup $$[G, G]$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$ and $$G / [G, G]$$ is Abelian.

**Proof**:

- (The commutator subgroup is normal) Check $$[G, G]$$ is stable under conjugations. Let $$a, b \in G$$ and $$g \in G$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

    $$
    g[a, b]g^{-1} = g (a b a^{-1} b^{-1}) g^{-1} = (g a g^{-1}) (g b g^{-1}) (g a^{-1} g^{-1}) (g b^{-1} g^{-1}) = [g a g^{-1}, g b g^{-1}]
    $$

    One could see that

    $$
    (g a^{-1} g^{-1}) (g a g^{-1}) = e_G \Longrightarrow g a^{-1} g^{-1} = (g a g^{-1})^{-1}
    $$

    and

    $$
    (g b^{-1} g^{-1}) (g b g^{-1}) = e_G \Longrightarrow g b^{-1} g^{-1} = (g b g^{-1})^{-1}
    $$

    Therefore, $$g[a, b] g^{-1} \in [G, G]$$. Therefore, $$[G, G]$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$.

- (The quotient group of $$G$$ module $$[G, G]$$ is Abelian)

    $$
    G/[G, G] = \{g [G, G] | g \in G\}
    $$

    Let $$a[G,G]$$ and $$b[G, G] \in G/[G, G]$$ be arbitrary, we take the comutator of $$a[G, G]$$ and $$b[G, G]$$:

    $$
    [a[G, G], b[G, G]] = a[G, G] b[G, G] a^{-1}[G, G] b^{-1}[G, G] = a b a^{-1} b^{-1} [G, G] = [a, b] [G, G] = [G, G]
    $$

    Since $$[a, b] \in [G, G]$$ by the defnition of commutator subgroup. From the previous remark, since $$[G, G] = \{e_{G/[G,G]}\}$$. Therefore, $$G/[G, G]$$ is Abelian.

#### Proposition 1.32 (A noral subgroup containing the commutator subgroup is Abelian)

Let $$N$$ be a normal subgroup of $$G$$. Then $$G / N$$ is Abelian if and only if $$[G, G] \subset N$$.

**Proof**:

By the previous lemma 1.30,

$$
G / N \text{ is Abelian} \Longleftrightarrow [G / N, G / N] = \{e_{G / N}\}
$$

If $$[G/N, G/N] = \{e_{G/N}\}$$, then we have:

$$
[G/N, G/N] = \{e_{G/N}\} \Longrightarrow [a N, b N] = N \Longrightarrow [a, b] N = N \Longrightarrow [a, b] \in N
$$

If $$[G, G] \subset N$$, then we have:

$$
[G, G] \subset N \Longrightarrow [a, b] \in N \Longrightarrow [a N, b N] = N \Longrightarrow [G/N, G/N] = \{e_{G/N}\}
$$

Therefore,


$$
G / N \text{ is Abelian} \Longleftrightarrow [G / N, G / N] = \{e_{G / N}\} \Longleftrightarrow [G, G] \subset N
$$

#### Lemma 1.33

For a subgroup $$H$$, if $$[G, G] \subset H$$, then $$H$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$.

#### Definition 1.34 (Products of groups)

Let $$A$$ and $$B$$ be groups, then the product of sets

$$
A \times B = \{(a, b) | a \in A, b \in B\}
$$

is a group with the group law given by

- $$(a_1, b_1) (a_2, b_2) = (a_1 a_2, b_1 b_2)$$

- Unit element: $$(e_A, e_B)$$

- Inverse: $$(a, b)^{-1} = (a^{-1}, b^{-1})$$

The set with the group law is called the **product of groups** $$A$$ and $$B$$.

#### Definition 1.35 (Identity maps from a group to a product of groups)

Let $$A$$ and $$B$$ be groups, then we define the following two maps:

$$
\begin{aligned}
i_{A}: A  & \rightarrow A \times B \text{ with } i_{A}(a)=(a, e_{B}) \\
i_{B}: B  & \rightarrow A \times B \text{ with } i_{B}(b)=(e_{A}, b)
\end{aligned}
$$

Then these maps have the following properties:

1. $$i_A$$ and $$i_B$$ are injective homomorphisms.

    **Proof**:

    $$
    i_A(a_1 a_2) = (a_1 a_2, e_B) = (a_1, e_B) (a_2, e_B) = i_A(a_1) i_A(a_2)
    $$

    Same for $$i_B$$.

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    A \cong i_{A}(A) & \subset A \times B \\
    B \cong i_{B}(B) & \subset A \times B
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    The injectivity of $$i_A$$ and $$i_B$$ is obvious.


2. $$i_A(A)$$ and $$i_B(B)$$ are normal subgroups of $$A \times B$$.

    **Proof**:

    Let $$(a, e_B) \in i_A(A)$$ and $$(c, d)$$ in $$A\times B$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

    $$
    (c, d)(a, e_B)(c^{-1}, d^{-1}) = (c a c^{-1}, d e_B d^{-1}) = (c a c^{-1}, e_B) \in i_A(A)
    $$

3. $$i_A(A)$$ and $$i_B(B)$$ commute with each other. i.e. $$x \in i_A(A), y \in i_B(B) \Longrightarrow xy = yx$$.

    **Proof**:
    
    Let $$(a, e_b) \in i_A(A)$$ and $$(e_A, b) \in i_B(B)$$ be arbitrary,

    $$
    (a, e_B) (e_A, b) = (a e_A, e_B b) = (a, b) = (e_A a, b e_B) = (e_A, b) (a, e_B)
    $$

#### Proposition 1.36 (There is an isomorphism between a group and the product of its normal subgroups)

Let $$G$$ be a group, $$A$$ and $$B$$ be normal subgroups of $$G$$ such that $$A \cap B = \{e_{G}\}$$ and $$G = A B = \{ab | a \in A, b \in B\}$$. Then the map

$$
\phi:A \times B \to G \text{ given by } \phi((a, b))=ab
$$

is an isomorphism of groups.

**Proof**:

1. `Hormorphism`: 

   Let $$a \in A$$ and $$b \in B$$ be arbitrary.
   First, we claim that the subgroups of $$A$$ and $$B$$ commute with each other, which means that $$``a \in A, b\in B \Longrightarrow ab = ba"$$. 

   Proof of the claim:  since $$A$$ and $$B$$ are normal.

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    b a b^{-1} \in A \Longrightarrow b a b^{-1}a^{-1} & \in A \\
    a b^{-1} a^{-1} \in B \Longrightarrow b a b^{-1} a^{-1}& \in B
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    By assumation, $$A \cap B = \{e_G\}$$, then $$b a b^{-1} a^{-1} = e_G$$. Therefore, $$b a = a b$$. Therefore, the subgroups of $$A$$ and $$B$$ commute with each other.

    Let $$(a,b) ,(a', b') \in A \times B$$ be arbitrary, then we have: 

    $$
    \phi((a,b) (a', b')) = \phi((a a', b b')) = a a' b b' = (ab) (a' b') = \phi((a, b)) \phi((a', b'))
    $$

2. `Bijective`

   1. `Surjective` :The surjectivity of $$\phi$$ is obvious by assumption.

   2. `Injective`: Let $$(a, b) \in \ke(\phi)$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

      $$
      \phi((a, b)) = ab = e_G \Longrightarrow a = b^{-1} \in A \cap B = \{e_G\} \Longrightarrow a = b = e_G
      $$

      Therefore, $$\ke(\phi) = \{e_{A \times B}\}$$.

#### Definition 1.37 (Product of finite many groups)

Let $$G_1, \ldots, G_n$$ be groups. The product of the groups $$G_1, \ldots, G_n$$ is the set

$$
G_{1} \times \ldots \times G_{n}=\left\{(g_{1}, \ldots, g_{n}) \mid g_{i} \in G_{i}, i = 1, \ldots, n\right\}
$$

The group law is given by

- $$(g_1, \ldots, g_n) (g_1', \ldots, g_n') = (g_1 g_1', \ldots, g_n g_n')$$

- Unit element: $$(e_{G_1}, \ldots, e_{G_n})$$

- Inverse: $$(g_1, \ldots, g_n)^{-1} = (g_1^{-1}, \ldots, g_n^{-1})$$

### 1.4. Abelian groups and p-primary groups

#### Lemma 1.38

Let $$G$$ be an Abelian group. If the orders of $$a, b \in G$$ be element with finite order,we say that $$a^n = e_G$$ and $$b^m = e_G$$. Then $$ab$$ is also an element with finite order. Moreover

$$
ab^{\operatorname{lcm}(n,m)} = e_G
$$

The set of elements with finite order in $$G$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$.

**Proof**:

1. `Finite order`: Since $$G$$ is Abelian, then we have:

    $$
    (ab)^{\operatorname{lcm}(n,m)} = a^{\operatorname{lcm}(n,m)} b^{\operatorname{lcm}(n,m)} = e_G e_G = e_G
    $$

2. `Subgroup`: The set of elements with finite order in $$G$$ is the intersection of all subgroups of $$G$$ that contain all elements with finite order. Therefore, it is a subgroup of $$G$$.

#### Definition 1.39 (Torsion Abelian group)

Let $$G$$ be a Abelian group. The set of elements of $$G$$ of finite order is called **the torsion subgroup of $$G$$** and is denoted by 

$$
G_{tors} = \{g \in G| \text{ the order of } g \text{ is finite}\}
$$

It is well-defined by the lemma $$1.38$$. If $$G = G_{tors}$$, then $$G$$ is called a **torsion Abelian group**. 

##### Remark

- Any finite Abelian group is a torsion Abelian group.

- The quotient group $$\Q / \Z$$ is a an infinite torsion Abelian group where $$\Q$$ and $$\Z$$ are not.

    **Proof**:

    Any rational number could add itself in finite times to get an integer. i.e.

    $$
    \frac{m}{n} + \frac{m}{n} + \ldots + \frac{m}{n} = m \in \Z
    $$

    add for $$n$$ times. Therefore, the element in $$\Q / \Z$$ has finite order. However, $$\Q$$ and $$\Z$$ are not torsion Abelian groups since $$\Q$$ and $$\Z$$ are infinite with not all elements have finite order.

- $$G$$ is an Abelian group, then the quotient group $$G / G_{tors}$$ has no element with finite order.

    **Proof**:

    Let $$g G_{tors} \in G / G_{tors}$$ be arbitrary, then we have:

    $$
    g G_{tors} = G_{tors} \Longleftrightarrow g \in G_{tors} \Longleftrightarrow g \text{ has finite order}
    $$

    Therefore, $$G / G_{tors}$$ has no element with finite order.

#### Definition 1.40 (p-primary group) 

Let $$G$$ be an Abelian group and let $$p$$ be a prime number. The set of elements $$g \in G$$ such that order of $$g$$ is a power of $$p$$ is called the **p-primary subgroup of $$G$$** and is denoted by $$G\{p\}$$. If $$G = G\{p\}$$, then $$G$$ is called a **p-primary torsion Abelian group**. 

$$
G\{P\} = \{g \in G| \text{ the order of } g \text{ is a power of } p\}
$$

It is well-defined by the lemma $$1.38$$.

#### Corollary 1.41 (A cyclic group is isomorphic to a product of $$p$$-primary groups)

Let $$n=p_{1}^{a_{1}} \ldots p_{m}^{a_{m}}$$, where $$p_{1}, \ldots, p_{m}$$ are prime numbers and $$a_{i} \geqslant 1$$, for $$i=1, \ldots, m$$. We have an isomorphism

$$
C_{n} \cong C_{p_{1}^{a_{1}}} \times \ldots \times C_{p_{m}^{a_{m}}}
$$

where $$C_n$$ is the cyclic group of order $$n$$.

**Proof**:

We prove this by induction on $$m$$.

1. (Base case) $$m = 1$$: $$n = p_1^{a_1}$$. There is nothing to do.

2. (

    

#### Lemma 1.36

Let $$F$$ be a finite set of primes. If $$G$$ is a finite Abelian group such that the order of any element of $$G$$ is disvisible only by primes in $$F$$, then $$|G|$$ is divisible only by primes in $$S$$. The converse is also true.

#### Proposition 1.37

Any finite Abelian group $$G$$ is isomorphic to the product of its-primary torsion subgroups.

### 1.5. Generators

#### Lemma 1.39

Let $$I$$ be a set. Suppose that for each $$i \in I$$ we are given a subgroup $$H_{i} \subset G$$. Then $$H=\cap_{i \in I} H_{i}$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$.

#### Definition 1.40 (Generators)

Let $$G$$ be a group and let $$S \subset G$$ be a set. The intersection of all subgroups of $$G$$ that contain $$S$$ is called the subgroup of $$G$$ generated by $$S$$. If $$G$$ is the only subgroup of $$G$$ that contains $$S$$, we say that the elements of $$S$$ generate $$G$$.

#### Definition 1.41 (Finite generated group)

A group $$G$$ is called finitely generated if there is a positive integer $$n$$ such that $$G$$ is generated by $$n$$ elements.

## 2. Groups acting on sets

### 2.1. Actions, orbits and stabilisers

#### Definition 2.1 (Group action)

Let $$G$$ be a group and let $$X$$ be a set. Let $$S(X)$$ be the group of bijections $$X \rightarrow X$$ with composition as the group law. An action of $$G$$ on $$X$$ is a homomorphism $$G \rightarrow S(X)$$.

#### Definition 2.2 (Faithful action)

An action of a group $$G$$ on a set $$X$$ is faithful if the map $$G \rightarrow S(X)$$ is injective.

#### Definition 2.4 ($$G$$-orbit, stabiliser)

Let $$G \times X \rightarrow X$$ be an action of a group $$G$$ on a set $$X$$. The $$G$$-orbit of an element $$x \in X$$ is the subset

$$
G(x)=\{g(x) \mid g \in G\} \subset X
$$

The stabiliser of $$x$$ is the subgroup

$$
\operatorname{St}_{G}(x)=\{g \in G \mid g(x)=x\} \subset G .
$$

#### Lemma 2.5

Let $$G \times X \rightarrow X$$ be an action of a group $$G$$ on $$X$$. Then $$\operatorname{St}(g(x))=g \operatorname{St}(x) g^{-1}$$.

#### Theorem 2.6 (Orbit-stabiliser theorem)

Let $$G \times X \rightarrow X$$ be an action of a group $$G$$ on a set $$X$$. For any $$x \in X$$ the map $$g \mapsto g(x)$$ gives a bijection of the set of left cosets $$G / \operatorname{St}(x)$$ with the orbit $$G(x)$$. In particular, if $$G$$ is a finite group, then $$|G(x)|=|G| /|\operatorname{St}(x)|$$ for any $$x \in X$$. If $$X$$ is a finite set and $$X=\cup_{i=1}^{n} G\left(x_{i}\right)$$ is a disjoint union of $$G$$-orbits, then

$$
|X|=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left|G\left(x_{i}\right)\right|=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[G: \operatorname{St}\left(x_{i}\right)\right]
$$

where $$\left[G: \operatorname{St}\left(x_{i}\right)\right]$$ is the index of $$\operatorname{St}\left(x_{i}\right)$$ in $$G$$.

### 2.2. Application of the orbit-stabiliser theorem

#### Theorem 2.7 (Caley's theorem)

Let $$G$$ be a finite group of order $$n$$. Then $$S_{n}$$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $$G$$.

#### Theorem 2.8 (Cauchy's theorem)

Let $$G$$ be a finite group of order $$n$$ and let $$p$$ be a prime factor of $$n$$. Then $$G$$ contains an element of order $$p$$.

#### Definition 2.9 ($$p$$-group)

Let $$p$$ be a prime. A finite group $$G$$ is called a $$p$$-group if the order of $$G$$ is a power of $$p$$.

#### Corollary 2.10

A finite group $$G$$ is a p-group if and only if the order of every element of $$G$$ is a power of $$p$$.

#### Theorem 2.11

Let $$G$$ be a p-group, where $$p$$ is a prime. Then the centre of $$G$$ is non-trivial, that is, $$Z(G) \neq\left\{e_{G}\right\}$$.
